     1. Add the required dependency to enable API gateway in pom.xml.
     2. Add annotation to enable the Api gateway service in the main class.
     3. Add properties in application.properties to route all traffic for /blog to the blog service.
     4. Test in Postman to see if you can access the Blog service through the API Gateway.
